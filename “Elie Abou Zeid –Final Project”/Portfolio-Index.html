		<p>	So, you are wondering about my existence?<br><br>
			My name is Elie Abou Zeid and I am a 22-year-old Lebanese “Management Information Systems” university student in Notre Dame University – Louaize.<br><br>
			My entire life I have been searching for my calling by trying out different hobbies and academic paths and I am happy to say that I might have found it.<br><br>
			You think I am going to tell you now? Think twice!<br><br>

		<p>During my life I have experimented in many types of activities to try and find myself. 
			<br>I have tried to learn different fighting styles, and as a result, I reached red belt in the Korean martial art “Taekwondo” and red belt in the Japanese martial art “Aikido” but stopped both as they didn’t fit my lifestyle. I took swimming classes for 3 years but, didn’t see myself going anywhere with it. I took guitar and singing lessons and stopped that after a while too. 
			<br><br>In the end, I found myself enjoying ski the most as it is the only sport I haven’t stopped for nine years, having travelled different locations and countries to exercise it along with all types of slope difficulties and off-slopes. 
			<br><br>All in all, I am a very outgoing person, as my flexibility and adaptability to any type of leisure activity helped me grow to become the social bomb I am today. As for the martial arts, never had to use it, however... don’t test me... :)

		<p>I have achieved a lot so far, notably this website is an achievement of its own. However, it doesn’t stop here, as life goes on, I will keep learning and training to empower my skillset and eventually enrich it. <span>Here is where I'm at, presently:</span> On a scale from 1 to 5<br> (1=poor ; 2=fair ; 3=good ; 4=very good ; 5=excellent) </p><br>
		<ul>
			<li>My <span>coding skills</span> are getting there as I am honing them by practicing at my university and at home through online courses that I subscribe to from time to time (<span>Java</span>: 3, <span>HTML5</span>: 5, <span>CSS</span>: 4, <span>Visual Basic</span>: 3, <span>Python</span>: 1, <span>JavaScript</span>: 1)</li><br>
